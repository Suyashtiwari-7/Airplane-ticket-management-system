## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Layer       | Technology         |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Frontend    | Tkinter (Python GUI) |
| Backend     | Python (OOP)        |
| Database    | SQLite3 + SQL Queries |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Tkinter (usually pre-installed with Python)
- SQLite3 (comes with Python)

### ▶️ Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```
```
airline_ticket_reservation/
│
├── main.py           # Main Python file containing GUI + logic
├── airline.db        # SQLite database file (auto-created)
└── README.md         # Project documentation
```
## 📄 Sample Data

- On first run, the application populates **dummy flight data** automatically.
- You can test **booking**, **searching**, and **cancellation** directly without setup.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Full stack **desktop application development** (GUI + Logic + Database)
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python
- **SQL query execution** within Python using `sqlite3`
- **Input validation** and **error handling** using `try-except` and message boxes
- **Real-time updates**, e.g., flight seat availability after booking


---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add **login/signup** functionality for users and admins
- Convert to a **web-based app** using Flask or Django
- Add **report export options** (PDF/CSV)
- Add **filters, pagination, and sorting** to flight search results
